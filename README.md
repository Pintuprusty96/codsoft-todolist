   - Click the "Add" button.

2. Edit a task:
   - Click the "Edit" button next to the task you want to edit.
   - Enter the updated task in the prompt dialog.
   - Click "OK" to save the changes.

3. Delete a task:
   - Click the "Delete" button next to the task you want to delete.
   - Confirm the deletion when prompted.

4. Tasks are stored locally, so they will persist even if you close the browser.
